## React Phantom Wallet Integration

This project is a React application that integrates with the Phantom wallet, a popular cryptocurrency wallet for Solana. It uses React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a fast frontend build tool that supports features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and out-of-the-box TypeScript support.

### Application Features
- Connect to the Phantom Wallet.
- Display the connected wallet's public key.
- Disconnect from the Phantom Wallet.
- Live updates in the UI based on wallet connection status.

### Getting Started

1. **Run the Application**: Click the 'Run' button to start the application. The Vite server will start, and the application will be available in the built-in web browser.

2. **Edit the Code**: Make changes to [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) to modify the application. The app includes functionality for connecting to and disconnecting from the Phantom wallet.

3. **Live Updates**: The application is set up with Hot Module Reloading (HMR). When you edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx), you will see the changes live-updated in the app.

### Configuration

- The application runs the `dev` script by default. This script is defined in the `package.json` file and starts the Vite development server with hot reloading.
- To configure the script or other run commands, edit the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit).

### Building for Production

- If you want to build this application for production, refer to the Vite documentation on [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html). This will guide you through optimizing your build for a production environment.

### Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: This is the main React component file where the Phantom wallet integration is implemented.
- `src/App.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- Other configuration files like `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `.replit` control various aspects of the application setup and build process.
